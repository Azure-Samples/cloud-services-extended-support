# Cloud Services (extended support) Samples

Cloud Services (extended support) is currently in public preview.
This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Cloud Services (extended support) is a new [Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) based deployment model for [Azure Cloud Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cloud-services/) product and is currently in public preview. Cloud Services (extended support) has the primary benefit of providing regional resiliency along with feature parity with Azure Cloud Services deployed using Azure Service Manager. It also offers some ARM capabilities such as role-based access and control (RBAC), tags, policy and supports deployment templates.  

With this change, the Azure Service Manager based deployment model for Cloud Services will be renamed [Cloud Services (classic)](../cloud-services/cloud-services-choose-me.md). You will retain the ability to build and rapidly deploy your web and cloud applications and services. You will be able to scale your cloud services infrastructure based on current demand and ensure that the performance of your applications can keep up while simultaneously reducing costs.
